# Workflow Use recording service

This service records a user's browser demonstration in an ephemeral Browserbase session. It does not execute workflows or expose a CDP endpoint.

ICE calls the service with `X-Workflow-Key`, `x-organization`, and `x-user-email`. Set these exact environment variables before running it:

- `WORKFLOW_USE_SERVICE_KEY`, a non-empty shared key used by ICE.
- `BROWSERBASE_API_KEY` and `BROWSERBASE_PROJECT_ID`.
- `BROWSERBASE_REGION`, optional, defaults to `eu-central-1`.
- `WORKFLOW_USE_HOST`, optional, defaults to `127.0.0.1`. Use `0.0.0.0` only in the container.
- `WORKFLOW_USE_PORT`, optional, defaults to `8090`.

The service runs one worker. Its recording TTL caps at 15 minutes, and Browserbase receives the same cap. It binds to loopback by default.

```bash
cd recording
uv sync --group dev
uv run playwright install chromium
WORKFLOW_USE_SERVICE_KEY=... uv run python -m workflow_use_recording
uv run pytest
```

Build and run the production image with one worker and a non-root user:

```bash
docker build -t workflow-use-recording .
docker run --rm -p 8090:8090 \
  -e WORKFLOW_USE_SERVICE_KEY \
  -e BROWSERBASE_API_KEY \
  -e BROWSERBASE_PROJECT_ID \
  workflow-use-recording
```

Captures remain only in process memory. A service restart loses active and stopped recordings. The API reports an unknown recording as unavailable or restarted rather than pretending it can recover it. A failed browser close remains pending and is retried by the running service; Browserbase's 15-minute keep-alive cap is the final cleanup fallback after process loss. The service does not persist Browserbase URLs, screenshots, or arbitrary CDP endpoints.

Never enter passwords, one-time codes, API keys, session tokens, or other secrets in a demonstration. The recorder blocks values from password fields and fields it recognizes as credential-related, but that detection is heuristic and cannot identify every unmarked secret field. Login and credential demonstrations are therefore unsupported in this release. There is no recoverable recording persistence.

`POST /recordings` accepts `{"url":"https://public.example"}`. `GET /recordings/{id}`, `POST /recordings/{id}/stop`, and `DELETE /recordings/{id}` require the same tenant and user that created the recording. Browserbase Live View links appear only while a recording is active and are not logged or persisted.

`GET /health` returns `{"status":"ok"}` without exposing configuration or credentials.
